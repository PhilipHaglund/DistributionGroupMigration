SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Migrate (Copy) Exchange On-premise distribution groups to Exchange Online (Office 365).

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Have you seen the following message:

    The action 'Set-DistributionGroup', '<property>', can't be performed on the object '<name>' because the object is being synchronized from your on-premises organization. This action should be performed on the object in your on-premises organization.

    This is because owners of an on-premises distribution group that's synced to Office 365 can't manage the distribution group in Exchange Online.
    The module DistributionGroupMigration is designed to help with this by migrating (copying) Exchange On-premise distribution groups to Exchange Online (Office 365).

EXAMPLES
    PS C:\> Initialize-OnPremDSTGroupToCloud -Group 'dstgroup001@contoso.com' -ExchangeServer exchprod01.contoso.com
    PS C:\> Set-NoAADSyncOnPremDSTGroup -Group 'dstgroup001@contoso.com' -ExchangeServer exchprod01.contoso.com
    PS C:\> # Remove-OnPremDSTGroup -Group 'dstgroup001@contoso.com' -ExchangeServer exchprod01.contoso.com
    PS C:\> Invoke-Command -ComputerName "<AADConnectServerName>" -ScriptBlock {Start-ADSyncSyncCycle} -Credental (Get-Credental 'AADConnectServerCredentials')
    PS C:\> Complete-OnPremDSTGroupToCloud -Group 'dstgroup001@contoso.com'
    PS C:\> # Optional, remove the group after completion. Force must be used when Complete-OnPremDSTGroupToCloud was ran before Remove-OnPremDSTGroup.
    PS C:\> Remove-OnPremDSTGroup -Group 'dstgroup001@contoso.com' -ExchangeServer exchprod01.contoso.com -Force
